## Description
This project is the start of a Banking app using React, Express, and MongoDB. In it's current state, it can create new accounts. Once an account is created, the app has the ability to log in the user allowing the user to withdraw and despoit. Using Express and MongoDB a simple backend was created. Now that a user has created an account, the server and database have the ability to store user's login information allowing for the page to be refreashed between sessions. This app is a single page application which uses React to maintain the state of the Bad Bank App!
